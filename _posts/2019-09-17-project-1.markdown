description: The emerging data-driven methods offer an alternative solution to the conventional physical reasoning by learning from high-fidelity training data. However, these methods usually lack interpretiability and require massive amounts of data in general. Hence, different approaches to incorporating prior knowledge within data-driven frameworks have been proposed to make use of both data and physics. While these approaches are successful, we demonstrate that their network architecture matters- most of the physics-based learning architectures are task specific, and can not adapt to diverse physical circumstances easily. As such, we propose the physics-based neural architecture search (PhysicsNAS) that is generalizable to all physical environments. PhysicsNAS learns both the network architectures and the associated weights with physics-inspired candidate modules, and opens the new avenue for physics-based learning. It is an important step towards flexible formulations of physics-based learning architectures for specific goals.
